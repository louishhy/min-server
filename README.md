# min-server

**_Minimalistic implementations for common server-side applications, optimized for learning purpose._**

## "Minimalistic"?
The `min-server` project aims to provide a series of **minimalistic** implementations optimized for learning
for common server-side applications 
to help beginners understand the underlying logic of APIs from the ground up
by providing easy-to-understand code and [documentations](https://minserver.louishhy.com/).

By minimalistic we mean:
1. **Less dependencies**: Use as few libraries as possible (since APIs can easily abstract away the underlying logic).
2. **Easy to interpret**: Write code that is easy to understand and follow.
    - Hence, notwithstanding (1), 
    do use libraries that abstract away the details that is not in the focus of the project
    since it helps readability. :)
3. **Focus on core**: Focus on the core idea of the application to reveal the main logic flow.

## Subprojects
### [MinHTTP](minhttp)
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)-like, minimalistic implementation of HTTP server from the `socket` level using only default Python libraries.

### MinWebSocket
ðŸ¥³ To be implemented, stay tuned!

## Why `min-server`?
Modern server applications and frameworks are extremely sophisticated. Although those careful engineering makes them powerful and production-ready, it can be overwhelming for beginners to understand the underlying logic of server applications from the source code.

The aim of `min-server` is to cut away the complexity and focus on the core flow of server applications, such as connection establishments, routing and handling messages. By understanding the basics with the source code and documentation, you can dive into more sophisticated frameworks with ease.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Because of the reasons mentioned above, `min-server` is _not_ designed for production use. Some mechanisms such as authentication are largely simplified or even omitted. 
>
> Do _not_ use `min-server` in production environments.
